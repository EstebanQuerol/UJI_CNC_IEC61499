UJI_CNC_IEC61499
================

Universitat Jaume I research project about the application of IEC 61499 stantard into the manufacturing field 

In this project we are attempting to use the distributed control estantar IEC 61499 to manage the production of complex parts
based on machining features on a CNC machine. To do so we are using the IEC61499 develoment tool 4DIAC tool and its  runtime 
FORTE.
