README for FORTE
================

This is first and simple usage documentation for 
FORTE: the FORDIAC Run-Time Environment


Development environment:
========================
  1. Get Cygwin and the Cywin development packages
  2. Get CMake (cmake.org)
  3. We strongly recommend Eclipse with CDT for developing  
  4. (optional) get boost.test (included in boost-framework) for testing 

Compile for PCs:
=======================
  1. Use CMake (e.g., cmake-gui) to set up development environment
     1.1. set source directory to FORTE main directory
     1.2. set target directory
       we recommend using a separate directory for binaries (e.g. /bin/posix) 
       within the FORTE main directory structure
     1.3. change settings and select modules to be included
     1.4. configure
     1.5. generate makefiles
     1.6. multiple setups/platforms can be maintained at the same time 
       1.6.1. set different target directory and repeat from 1.2.    
  2. Directly in Cygwin
  	 2.1. Go into the defined target directory
  	 2.2. Run "make" 
  	 2.2.1. the resulting forte will be in the directory
  	 		{target dir}/src	
  3. Within Eclipse 
  	 3.1. Import the project
  	 3.2. Choose/create make target "all" in the target directory
  	 3.3. the resulting forte will be in the directory
  	 		{target dir}/src
  
Compile for DIGI Connect ME (to be updated for CMake):
======================================================
  1. General steps	
	 1.1 First of all you need to copy the board support package with all libraries and 
	     includes files into the directory bin/digime.
	 1.2 Add the files appconf.h and appconf_api.c which come along with the examples of 
	     NetOS into the directory src/arch/netos
	 1.3 configure appconf.h to your application's values           
  2. Directly in Cygwin
  	 2.1 Go into the FORTE main directory
  	 2.2 Run setup_pc script: ./setup_digimi.sh
  	 2.3 Run make script: ./fortemake.sh all
  	 2.4 The resulting forte will be in the directory
  	 		./bin/digime/src	
  3. Within Eclipse 
  	 3.1 Import the project
  	 3.2 Choose setup_digime from the make targets
  	 3.3 Choose all from the make targets
  	 3.4 The resulting forte will be in the directory
  	 		./bin/digime/src
