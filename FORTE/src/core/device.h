/*!\ingroup CORE CDevice represents a device according to IEC 61499. CDevice contains
      - one or more IEC 61499 compliant resources (CResource),
      -	a device management (CDeviceAdministrator)
      -	a function block execution environment (CFBNExecution)
      -	a library (CTypeLib) which administrates the types the 1499 device is
        capable of
      - External event interface for handling interrupts and other external notifications.
      -	FORTE-HAL: FORTE Hardware Abstraction Layer

    There are different device type’s available (e.g. remote device RMT_DEV)
    for different tasks which have different device configurations
    (resources function blocks …) and device parameters.
 * @author AZ
 * @version 20090801/mmm - executeMGMCommand is not virtual anymore. Changed class structure - CDevice is now derived from
 * CResource, therefore CDevice now has a objecthandler instead of like being an objecthandler before
 * Deleted createFBObject. Added parameter C61499Class0ObjectHandler* pa_poObjectHandler to constructor
 * @version 20070911/AZ - renamed execute() to startDevice()
 * @version 20060719/AZ - changed base class to C61499ObjectHandler in order to simplify management commands
 * @version 20050701/AZ - Initial version as basis for the interface documentation
